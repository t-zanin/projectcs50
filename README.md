### About the Project:

This app was meticulously developed to be an indispensable tool for meticulously managing my daily finances. Originating from the need for an intuitive and functional solution, the primary goal was to create an application that provided clarity and effectiveness in the detailed analysis of expenses and income, offering valuable insights into my financial habits.

### Highlighted Features:

- **Simplified Transaction Logging:** One of the key features is the simplicity in recording expenses and income. The form allows for details such as description, amount, category, and transaction type, ensuring a detailed and organized record of finances.
- **Detailed Visual Insights:** One of the most powerful features is generating graphs. These graphs offer a clear and detailed visual representation of spending distribution over time and by categories, allowing for a deeper analysis of financial patterns.
- **Flexible Period Control:** The ability to select different time periods, be it weekly, monthly, or annually, is crucial for gaining a more detailed and contextualized understanding of finances at specific moments.

### Project Files Breakdown:

**app.py:**

This file, the backbone of the backend, is built on the Flask framework. It's responsible for creating routes and handling application data. The /add_transaction and /transactions routes manage the insertion and retrieval of transactions in the SQLite database, respectively.
```python
# Database and table creation if they don't exist
conn = sqlite3.connect('transactions.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        description TEXT,
        amount FLOAT,
        category TEXT,
        type TEXT
    )
''')
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

**index.html:**

The HTML file serves as the user interface, interacting with JavaScript to display transactions and graphs generated by the backend. All interactive and informative elements of the application are contained in this file.
```html
<!-- Input fields for transaction details -->
<label for="description">Description:</label>
<input type="text" id="description" name="description" required><br><br>

<label for="amount">Amount:</label>
<input type="number" id="amount" name="amount" required><br><br>

<label for="category">Category:</label>
<input type="text" id="category" name="category" required><br><br>

<label for="type">Type:</label>
<select id="type" name="type">
    <option value="expense">Expense</option>
    <option value="income">Income</option>
</select><br><br>

<input type="submit" value="Add Transaction">
```

**styles.css:**

Styling for the interface is performed in this file. It was crucial to enhance the user experience by applying styles to HTML elements, creating an attractive, intuitive, and cohesive interface.
```css
/* Interface Styles */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Input field styles */
input[type="text"],
input[type="number"],
select {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 8px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 4px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Submit button styles */
input[type="submit"] {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 4px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

input[type="submit"]:hover {
    background-color: #555;
}
```

**script.js:**

This JavaScript file manages communication between the interface and the backend. It controls sending form data to the server, updating graphs based on the selected period, and handling server responses after transaction submissions.
```javascript
document.getElementById('add-transaction-form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevents default form submission behavior

    const description = document.getElementById('description').value;
    const amount = document.getElementById('amount').value;
    const category = document.getElementById('category').value;
    const type = document.getElementById('type').value;

    // ...
    // Code responsible for validating form fields and sending data to the backend
    // ...
});

function updateChart() {
    const selectedPeriod = document.getElementById('period').value;

    // ...
    // Code to fetch backend data and update the graphs based on the selected period
    // ...
}

// Initial call to update the graphs on the page
updateChart();
```

### Decision-Making and Choices in the Development Process:

The selection of Flask and SQLite as the main frameworks was strategic. Flask was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in managing routes and data, while SQLite was adopted for its seamless integration with Flask and its lightweight nature, ideal for this project. Chart.js was chosen for graph creation due to its user-friendly approach and quality visualizations, allowing for dynamic and informative charts.

### Reflections on the Creation Process:

Throughout development, the primary focus was

 on creating a simple yet robust interface to manage daily finances. Data validation was crucial to ensure consistency and information security, while clear graphs made data interpretation easier.

### Future Perspectives:

This application is just the starting point and can be expanded with additional features, such as user authentication, improved graphical interface, and more complex financial analyses. I'm excited to continue developing and refining this tool, exploring new possibilities to enhance personal financial management.
